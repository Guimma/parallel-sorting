# parallel-sorting

## What is this?

This is a school project by students of PUC-MG.

We were instructed to implement 4 sorting algorithms (Quicksort, Mergesort and 2 others, of our choosing) with parallelization using [OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org/) and test their efficiency.

## How does it work?

### How to run?

Run ```make```

After it's done, run ```./output < input.txt```

### How to debug?

If you've run make before, run ```make clear```

Run ```make debug```

After it's done, run ```gdb debug```
